Idea: a program that takes text and shifts every letter up/down in the alphabet to decript a message. 

Should take a phrase and output that phrase in 26 differen't combinitations with a = a, b, c ... y

To create this we should first take a phrase from phrase.txt 

To Encrypt file use
    Java Encrypt.java int_Shift_Value

To Decrypt File use
    Java Decrypt.java
